🧪 TEST: Conflicting Aspects - Product Quality vs Service
================================================================================
Review: This laptop has amazing performance, top-notch build quality, and cutting-edge specs, but the custom
er service was absolutely terrible - they hung up on me twice and delivery took 3 weeks with damaged packagi
ng.
Expected Advantage: LangChain should handle disagreement between Quality (positive) and Experience (negative
) better through discussion
