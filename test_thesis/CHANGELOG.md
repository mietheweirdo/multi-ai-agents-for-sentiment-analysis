## Version Numbering

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- **MAJOR** version for incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version for backwards-compatible functionality additions
- **PATCH** version for backwards-compatible bug fixes

## Release Process

1. **Feature Development**: New features developed in feature branches
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing with quality assurance
3. **Documentation**: Updated documentation and examples
4. **Release Candidate**: Pre-release testing and validation
5. **Production Release**: Stable release with full documentation

## Migration Guides

### Migrating from v1.x to v2.x

**Breaking Changes:**
- Configuration class structure updated
- Output JSON format changed
- Method signatures updated for better type safety

**Migration Steps:**
1. Update configuration to use new `PreprocessingConfig` class
2. Update output parsing to use new JSON structure
3. Review and update any custom PII patterns
4. Test with your existing data pipeline

**Example Migration:**
```python
# Old v1.x code
from preprocessing import Preprocessor
processor = Preprocessor(min_length=5, max_length=1000)

# New v2.x code
from advanced_preprocessing import AgentReadyPreprocessor, PreprocessingConfig
config = PreprocessingConfig(min_text_length=5, max_text_length=1000)
processor = AgentReadyPreprocessor(config)
```

## Support Policy

- **Current Version (2.x)**: Full support with new features and bug fixes
- **Previous Version (1.x)**: Security fixes only (until December 2025)
- **Legacy Versions**: No longer supported
