I had Pro1 before and thought Pro2 was gonna improve the bass, but nope, still so weak I wanna cry.. now that airpods4 have even weaker bass than Pro2, I don't think it's gonna be sufficient for me.. which is a damn shame 'cause I really want open tip buds without the rubbers, and I like its microphone quality and the squeeze controls.."

There are folks around me who state that these cause cancer, or tumours of some sort.

I just figured I'd ask a professional consumer his opinion based on experience. Thanks."
