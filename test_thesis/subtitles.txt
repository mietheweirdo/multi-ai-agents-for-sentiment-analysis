Kick in the door Waving the coco
Eat your popcorn don’t think about cutting in
I talk that talk Runways I walk walk
Eyes closed pop pop no need to look
One by one then Two by two
Everything collapses at the flick of my fingertip
Quite fancy for a fake show
Makes no sense You couldn’t get a dollar outta me
It’s tonight, I’m a flower with venom
After taking your soul Look what you made us do
The fire that’ll slowly put you to sleep, so beautiful it’s brutal
I bring the pain like
This that pink venom
Get ‘em, get ‘em, get ‘em
Straight to ya dome like whoa whoa whoa
Straight to ya dome like ah ah ah
Taste that pink venom
Get ‘em, get ‘em, get ‘em
Straight to ya dome like whoa whoa whoa
Straight to ya dome like ah ah ah 
Black paint and ammo, got bodies like Rambo
Rest in peace, please light up a candle
This da life of a vandal, masked up and I’m still in Celine
Designer crimes or it wouldn’t be me
Diamonds shinin’ drive in silence I don’t mind it I’m ridin’
Flyin’ private side by side with da pilot Up in the sky
And I’m wildin’, stylin’ on them and there’s no chance
Cuz we got bodies on bodies like this a slow dance
It’s tonight, I’m a flower with venom
After taking your soul Look what you made us do
The fire that’ll slowly put you to sleep, so beautiful it’s brutal
I bring the pain like
This that pink venom
Get ‘em, get ‘em, get ‘em
Straight to ya dome like whoa whoa whoa 
Straight to ya dome like ah ah ah
Taste that pink venom
Get ‘em, get ‘em, get ‘em
Straight to ya dome like whoa whoa whoa
Straight to ya dome like ah ah ah
Provoke us if you’d like
You can’t handle it and you know this
Already spread, shot that potion, pink ocean right before your eyes
Come and give me all the smoke, all or nothing, like I’m so rock and roll
Come and give me all the smoke, line ‘em up, STOP DROP
I bring the pain like
La tatata La tatata La tatata La tatata
La tatata La tatata
Straight to ya
Straight to ya dome like
La tatata La tatata La tatata La tatata
La tatata La tatata
I bring the pain like
