    "content": "I enjoyed your update on the rumored features of the iPhone 17 phones but it is inaccurate to call the telephoto lens change a 'downgrade'.  If it were a zoom lens, then it would certainly be preferable for it to optically extend to 5x rather than 3.5x.  However, Apple uses three prime lens in its Pro iPhones that cannot be optically zoomed.  The iPhone 16 Pro''s lenses are 13mm equivalent (ultra wide), 24mm equivalent (wide), and 120mm equivalent (telephoto).  Providing a 5x telephoto lens on the iPhone 16 Pro that has a focal length that is so much longer that the wide lens came at a huge cost.  Any pictures taken from 24mm to 119mm must use the 24mm wide lens and digitally crop because the telephoto lens cannot take over until 120mm.  This isn't a problem for the modest crops needed in the lower part of that range but drastic cropping that throws away most of the pixels is required at the higher end of the range, where most portrait shots are taken.  The reported iPhone 17 Pro's 3.5x telephoto lens will kick in at about 85mm, making pictures much sharper in the heavily-used 85-119mm range while only sacrificing a minor amount of sharpness for telephoto shots at or above 120mm."

At least if Apple had switched to a sodium ion battery, we'll get more out of the battery usage despite being prone to longevity issues. This news doesn't sound good. 7:49 Nah, I ain't believe this one... Apple is just making excuses. How can the 5x telephoto lens give less cropping quality to a 3x telephoto lens? Is this really true? Someone please explain to me what's going on here. Apple you have some explaining to do."
