Core Architecture
The system consists of specialized, communicating AI agents that work both independently and collaboratively:

Coordinator Agent: Orchestrates workflows and facilitates communication between agents
Scraper Agent: Collects reviews from Shopee API with intelligent rate limiting
Preprocessor Agent: Cleans and normalizes text data for analysis
Analyzer Agent: Performs baseline sentiment analysis using GPT-4

Reporter Agent: Generates comprehensive visualizations and insights
Memory Manager Agent: Maintains context and enables learning across analyses
Communication Framework
The heart of the system is a sophisticated communication framework enabling agent collaboration:

Message Protocol: Standardized format with message types (requests, responses, proposals, etc.)
Message Broker: Central hub for routing messages between agents
Protocol Handlers: Specialized modules implementing coordination protocols
Communication Patterns: Request-Response, Voting, Consensus Building, Broadcasting
Net Promoter Score (NPS): For business-oriented customer categorization
Advanced Capabilities
Collaborative Decision-Making: Agents vote and build consensus on ambiguous reviews
Semantic Memory: Vector-based storage of analysis insights for future reference
Conflict Resolution: Protocols for resolving disagreements between agents
Proactive Information Sharing: Agents broadcast discoveries to the collective
Continuous Learning: System improves through memory consolidation over time
Technical Implementation
Language: Python for agent implementation
Embedding Models: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small/large for semantic understanding
LLM Integration: GPT-4 for sophisticated text analysis
Vector Database: Qdrant for similarity search in the memory system
Visualization: Matplotlib/Seaborn for insight presentation
Business Value
The system delivers actionable e-commerce intelligence:

Deeper understanding of customer sentiment beyond star ratings
Identification of specific emotion patterns in product reception
